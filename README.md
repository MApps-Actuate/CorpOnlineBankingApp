The Corporate Online Banking demo is an example of a day-in-the-life scenario of someone in Treasury Services. Prospects doing cash management, banking and treasury management would be interested in this demo. This demo highlights some of the interactive capability of dashboards by effecting simulations through our pub/sub functionality. A real-world Excel spreadsheet based on a format from one of our customers is highlighted thru drilldown. All BIRT content is internationlized for multiple languages. This demo helps prospects see our products in action as an integral part of an application.
